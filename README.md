# ESPN-Web-Scraper

This is a python project that contains a  web scraper to mine ESPN fantasy football web data from their API. Implements pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to work with the data. The goal of the project was to analyze the 2020 season for my personal league to discover how luck affected the final rankings.
